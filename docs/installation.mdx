# Installation

DucklingScript has been test on:

- Windows 11
- MacOS Ventura
- Ubuntu Jammy (Linux)

### Step One
Make sure to have Python 3.11 or higher installed.

There are many places on the internet that will explain how to download Python, but if you are on Windows, I recommend going [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

From here, you can either use pipx or pip to install DucklingScript; I highly recommend using pipx, because it handles putting the scripts on `PATH` for you.

    ## Step Two 
    Install Pipx:
    ```
    python3.11 -m pip install pipx
    python3.11 -m pipx ensurepath
    ```
    :::info
    It is recommended that if you have mulitple Python versions to put the python version at the end of the command, as seen above.
    :::

    Restart your terminal, and then this command should run flawlessly:
    ```
    pipx --version
    ```

    ## Step Three
    Install `ducklingscript` by running this command:
    ```
    pipx install ducklingscript
    ```

    ## Step Four
    You can now properly run the command by using `duckling`:
    ```
    duckling --help
    ```

  <TabItem value="nopipx" label="Without pipx">
    ## Step Two 
    To install on any of the major operating systems, simply run:
    ```
    pip3.11 install ducklingscript
    ```
    :::info
    It is recommended that if you have mulitple Python versions to put the python version at the end of the command, as seen above.
    :::

    ## Step Three
    You now have a few options on how to run the command. This way works in most circumstances:
    ```
    duckling --help
    ```
    However, if the script is not put on PATH, then it might be best to do it this way:
    ```
    pip -m ducklingscript --help
    ```
  </TabItem>
