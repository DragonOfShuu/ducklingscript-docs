# Installation

DucklingScript has been tested on:
- Windows 11
- MacOS Ventura
- Ubuntu Jammy (Linux)

### Step One
Our ducks are most familiar with Python 3.11, but they'll probably work with most later versions as well. Just make sure you meet the minimum version (Python 3.11) or they might get a bit pecky.

Many have explained how to install Python, but if you're not familiar with the eggcellent language the best place to look is pretty much always on the [official site](https://www.python.org).

Once you've got the basics working you can waddle your way through the install with `pip` or `pipx`. Though our lab coat-wearing waterfowl generally recommend `pipx` since that will handle putting the scripts on `PATH` so you (hopefully) don't have to worry about it.

    ## With pipx
    ### Step Two
    If you don't have pipx, you can install it with:
    ```
    python3.11 -m pip install pipx
    python3.11 -m pipx ensurepath
    ```
    :::info
    We do recommend that if you have multiple Python versions you put the Python version at the end of the command as seen above.
    :::

    Once `pipx` is in place run this to check that it's working properly:
    ```
    pipx --version
    ```

    ### Step Three
    If `pipx` is working and you're ready to get quackin, getting DucklingScript on your machine is as simple as:
    ```
    pipx install ducklingscript
    ```

    ### Step Four
    Assuming everything has gone correctly you should now be able to run the command below and your new ducks will quack back with the basics:
    ```
    duckling --help
    ```

    ## Without pipx
    ### Step Two 
    If pipx is too plucky you can install DucklingScript on most of the major operating systems with:
    ```
    pip3.11 install ducklingscript
    ```
    :::info
    We do recommend that if you have multiple Python versions put the Python version at the end of the command as seen above.

    ### Step Three
    You now have a few options on how to run the command. This way works in most circumstances:
    ```
    duckling --help
    ```
    However, if the script is not put on PATH, then it might be best to do it this way:
    That said if you haven't got your ducks on `PATH` your best option is probably:
    ```
    pip -m ducklingscript --help
    ```
