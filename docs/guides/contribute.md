# Contributing
If you'd like to contribute our ducks will need you to be using Python version 3.11 or higher, if you don't already have this and end up with multiple Python versions installed our experimenting eggheads recommend putting the Python version at the end of any command involving `python` or `pip` to avoid mixing Python versions like so:

```
python3.11 --version
pip3.11 --version
```
## Steps to Contribution
### Installing Poetry
Along with Python 3.11+, you will need to install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) which you can install either following their documentation or the steps given below. Along with this, the white-coat water-borns recommend using `pipx` the documentation for which is available [here](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/)., Â though `poetry` offers a variety of options.

Our ducks cooked up the following steps to install `pipx` and `poetry` on Windows, but the `pipx` authors have let us know they suggest using `brew` to install `pipx` when using MacOS.
```
python3.11 -m pip install pipx
python3.11 -m pipx ensurepath
```

Restart your terminal, then run:
```
pipx install poetry
poetry --version
```
Poetry should now work as a command.

### With Poetry Installed
Once you have `poetry` installed you should also install the necessary dependencies and open the environment for your project. This can be done by running these commands:
```
poetry install --with dev
poetry shell
```

Assuming everything has gone correctly you can now call upon our ducks in the CLI using the `duckling` command like below!
```
duckling --version
```

### Contribution Requirements
Assuming you've met all the prior requirements and want to make a pull request, make sure that you polish your project within the environment provided by poetry using the by running the provided `polish` command. This can be done like so:

```
poetry run poe polish
```

Make sure that ruff accepts your changes too!

Along with this our ducks would like you to ensure that you pass all relevant tests which you can check by running this command:
```
poetry run pytest
```

:::tip[Pull Request Note]
