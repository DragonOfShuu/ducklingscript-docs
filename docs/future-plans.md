# Future Plans
DucklingScript is still not fully complete, so naturally of course there are still plans in the works.

Here are the main ones:
- **Add Plugin Support**\
This will allow users to use plugins made by the community; these could include macros (such as open powershell), or possibly new functionality (like a block command).

- **Add Built-in Flipper-Connect System**\
This would allow a developer to compile their code directly onto the flipper, which cuts out the need to use a software such as qFlipper.

- **Live Python Interpretation**\
This would run your code directly on your computer, and skip the process of compiling to Rubber Ducky Language 1.0.
