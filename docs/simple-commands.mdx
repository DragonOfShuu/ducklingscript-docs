# Simple Commands
Simple commands can be characterized by a command that is a command and no argument, or a command with arguments, and no trailing code blocks. All Rubber Ducky 1.0 and Flipper Commands are Simple Commands.

However, in DucklingScript they have extended syntax.

## Command Grouping
Using indentation, you don't have to repeat yourself. You can simply make an indentation after the command, and write all arguments for the command. This may seem a bit confusing, so here's an example:

DucklingScript
```
STRING 
    Hello World!
    I enjoy DucklingScript!
```
Compiles into:
```
STRING Hello World!
STRING I enjoy DucklingScript!
```

This is a powerful feature, allowing you to type out everything you need all at once, instead of repeatedly typing `STRING`.

However, if you start using indents inside of those indents, you might encounter an error. You may need these extra indents if you are for example having your injection device write code. In that case, simply use three quotation marks like so:
```
STRINGLN
    """
    print("Starting Hacking Software...")
    for i in range(10):
        print(f"Hacking your pc in {i} second(s)")
        if i < 4:
            print("This is your final warning!")
    """
```

## Dollar Sign Operator
All simple commands that don't already [evaluate](/docs/expression-eval) their arguments can use the dollar sign operator. This turns the argument into an expression that will evaluated.

This allows you to write mathematical expressions, or use variables; you can read more of that [here](/docs/expression-eval).

:::warning
When using the dollar sign operator, all strings are required to be incased in quotations like this: "Hello World"
:::

### Examples
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="example1" label="Example 1" default>
    DucklingScript:
    ```
    $CTRL 1+1
    ```
    Compiled:
    ```
    CTRL 2
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="example2" label="Example 2">
    DucklingScript:
    ```
    $STRING "Hello " + "world!"
    ```
    Compiled:
    ```
    STRING Hello world!
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
This becomes more relevant and more important when we introduce variables.

## Block Commands
All Block commands will be commands that require an argument, and then a code block after. As of writing, all block commands are added by DucklingScript.

### Example
DucklingScript:
```
REM Command with arg
REPEAT 10
    REM Command's code block
    STRING foo
    STRING bar
```
