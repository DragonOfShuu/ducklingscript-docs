# FUNCTION
`FUNC/FUNCTION` allows you to run the same piece of code as many times as you want, wherever you want along with the ability to control the variables inside.

To make a function, use the command named either `FUNC` or `FUNCTION`. After that, give the name, then following the name include all variable names separated by a comma.

To run a function, use the `RUN` command, followed by the name of the function to run, and then the value for all variables separated by comma in order as they were declared on function creation.

**Syntax:** `FUNC <name> <optional paramaters>`
