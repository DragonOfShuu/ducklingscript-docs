# START/STARTENV/STARTCODE
`START` compiles the code, and adds that files ending environment to this one.

`STARTCODE` only compiles the code, and does not add the file's environment to this one.

`STARTENV` only gives the ending environment, and does not give the compiled code.

**Syntax:** `START <file_path>` or `STARTCODE <file_path>` or `STARTENV <file_path>`

<Tabs>
 <TabItem value="start_example" label="START" default>
    File we want to include.
    ```
    REM My file name is greetings.txt!
    FUNC hello
        STRING Hello World
    STRING Goodbye!
    ```

    Script where we `START` the referenced file.
    ```
    START .greetings.txt
    RUN hello
    ```

    Compiled
    ```
    STRING Hello World
    STRING Goodbye!
    ```
    Notice both the behavior from the function and the execution of the code after carry over to the final compilation.
 </TabItem>
    
 <TabItem value="startcode_example" label="STARTCODE">
    File we want to include.
    ```
    REM My file name is greetings.txt!
    FUNC hello
        STRING Hello World
    STRING Goodbye!
    ```

    Script where we `STARTCODE` the referenced file.
    ```
    STARTCODE .greetings.txt
    REM We can't RUN hello because STARTCODE does not transfer it.
    ```

    Compiled
    ```
    STRING Goodbye!
    ```
    In this case the execution of the code after the function transfers, but the environment (in this case the function itself) does not so we can't reference it.
 </TabItem>

 <TabItem value="startenv_example" label="STARTENV">
    File we want to include.
    ```
    REM My file name is greetings.txt!
    FUNC hello
        STRING Hello World
    STRING Goodbye!
    ```

    Script where we `STARTENV` the referenced file.
    ```
    STARTENV .greetings.txt
    RUN hello
    REM Here we can RUN hello, but STRING Goodbye! will never run because STARTENV doesn't transfer it.
    ```

    Compiled
    ```
    STRING Hello World
    ```
    In this case the environment (in this case the function) transfers and we can call it, however the code after it doesn't transfer and thus doesn't run.
