# What is Quackinter?
An interpreter designed with Rubber Ducky Scripting Language 1.0 and the flipper zero extension in mind, Quackinter serves as your go to filter making sure the water in your code is clean before you put it forward to use in the pond. You can run your DucklingScript / Rubber Ducky Scripting Language 1.0 directly on your computer.

# Why Use Quackinter?
Quackinter is simple and easy to use, and has built in support with DucklingScript, allowing you to not just swim but fly too.

If you aren't writing Duckling for the flipper or another external device, Quackinter also has you covered. Quackinter allows you to use special keys without the added syntax required by many other versions of Rubber Ducky Scripting Language 1.0. It comes with many other features as well, such as a `PRINTLN` command that prints a line during execution.
