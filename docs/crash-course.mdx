# DucklingScript: "Crash Course"

First, make sure to check the [Language Basics](/docs/language-basics), and look through the documentation there to learn Rubber Ducky 1.0 and the Flipper commands.

## Project Creation
To create a new project, you can use the `new` command. Simply give the name for your project, and optionally a directory:
```
duckling new example-proj
```
:::info
You don't have to make a project; you can simply make a txt file and compile it if you wish.
:::

After making the project, go into the folder and you will see a `config.yaml` and a `main.txt`. Any time your run the project, any of your global config settings will be overrided by the config inside the project.

To compile your project, simply run this command in the terminal while in your project:
```
duckling compile main.txt
```

When compiling any file in the root directory of your project, the config file will automatically be used.

DucklingScript files use the `.txt` file extension. This will be important for when we import external files later.
