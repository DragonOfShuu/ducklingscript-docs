# Simple Commands
Our webbed walkers refer to any command that doesn't require a trailing code block to work (regardless of whether it has arguments) as a "Simple Command", among these are every command from Rubber Ducky 1.0 and the Flipper Commands.

With that said, however, our drifting-down keepers have added a bit of extended syntax to help you.

## Command Grouping
To help cut down on repeating yourself we've taught the ducks to recognize indentation after a command, all you have to do is write the arguments like so:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="string_example" label="STRING" default>
    DucklingScript
    ```
    STRING 
    Hello World!
    I enjoy DucklingScript!
    ```

    Compiles into:
    ```
    STRING Hello World!
    STRING I enjoy DucklingScript!
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="stringln_example" label="STRINGLN">
    DucklingScript
    ```
    STRINGLN
    Hello,
    pond,
    I am a duck!
    ```

    Compiles into:
    ```
    STRINGLN Hello,
    STRINGLN pond,
    STRINGLN I am a duck!
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="var_example" label="VAR">
    DucklingScript
    ```
    VAR
    a 10
    b 30
    c "quack"
    ```

    Compiles into:
    ```
    VAR a 10
    VAR b 30
    VAR c "quack"
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
\
With this new feature though, adding indents to indents might scare the feathers off our floating friends, which may be a problem for use cases like having our ducks right code for you. No worries though because our water warriors thought of this and so if you want to use indents just throw in some triple quotation like this:

```
STRINGLN
  """
  print("Starting Hacking Software...")
  for i in range(10):
  print(f"Hacking your pc in {i} second(s)")
  if i < 4:
  print("This is your final warning!")
  """
```

## Dollar Sign Operator
To save time our ducks don't [evaluate](./expression-eval) many commands by default which is usually not a problem, but if you need them to take a closer look for you preceeding the command with a dollar sign (`$`) will turn the whole thing into an expression which will be evaluated.

This means our ducks can recognize mathematical expressions, concatenation, variables, and more in your commands; if you're still not sure what that means for you feel free to [check it out](./expression-eval)!

:::warning
Our ducks encourage using the dollar sign operator, but would like to note that since it [evaluates](./expression-eval) everything, `string`(s) should be encased in quatations like so: "Hello Pond".

### Examples
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="example1" label="Example 1" default>
    DucklingScript
    ```
    $CTRL 1+1
    ```

    Compiled
    ```
    CTRL 2
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="example2" label="Example 2">
    DucklingScript
    ```
    $STRING "Hello " + "world!"
    ```

    Compiled
    ```
    STRING Hello world!
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="example3" label="Example 3">
    DucklingScript
    ```
    VAR duck_food "birdseed"
    VAR human_food "bread"
    $STRINGLN "Feed ducks " + duck_food + ", not " + human_food + "!"
    ```

    Compiled
    ```
    STRINGLN Feed ducks birdseed, not bread!
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Block Commands
Along with these our wiggly waddlers have also added a **brand new** type of command! These are commands that have arguments and are followed by a code block, we call them "Block Commands" and as of writing, they are *exclusive* to DucklingScript!

### Example
DucklingScript:
```
REM This is the Block Command! v
REPEAT 3
 REM And this is the code block!
 STRING waddle
 STRING quack
```

Compiled
```
STRING waddle
STRING quack
STRING waddle
STRING quack
STRING waddle
STRING quack
```

*More quacking on `REPEAT` [here](./flow-control#for-loops).
