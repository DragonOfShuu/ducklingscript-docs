# Why DucklingScript?
Why flop when you can waddle, DucklingScript offers many helpful features such as:

## Type Safety
With our professional poultry alreay compiling each line, DucklingScript premtively validates your code will work for your hardware. And if there's any errors they'll helpfully point out where and why!

## Flow Control
While Rubber Ducky Scripting Language 1.0 and even the Flipper's implementation don't add any kind of flow control. Our feathered friends give you the power to swim back around with the implementation of if statements, for/while loops, breakloop, and more!

## Syntactical Speed
When working with Rubber Ducky 1.0 you might find yourself constantly laying the same eggs, but with DucklingScript we've added many commands to cut down on repetition in code and even made some syntax changes to help you type less to do more! [Check it out!](./syntax-changes)
