# Why DucklingScript?
Why flop when you can waddle, DucklingScript offers many helpful features such as:

## Type Safety
With our professional poultry already compiling each line, DucklingScript preemptively validates your code will work for your hardware. And if there are any errors they'll helpfully point out where and why!

## Flow Control
While the Rubber Ducky Scripting Language 1.0 and even the Flipper's implementation don't add any flow control, our feathered friends give you the power to swim back around with the implementation of if statements, for/while loops, breakloop, and more!

## Syntactical Speed
When working with Rubber Ducky 1.0 you might find yourself constantly laying the same eggs, but with DucklingScript we've added many commands to cut down on repetition in code and even made some syntax changes to help you type less to do more! [Check it out!](./crash-course/simple-commands#command-grouping)

## Forward Compatability
New command in Rubber Ducky that DucklingScript doesn't cover? No problem! Instead of throwing a fit about it, our quack team will simply let you know, which means you can use what you want, when you want; even if we're not sure what it is! Better still, if having our ducks notify you is ruffling your feathers you can simply ask them to stop by switching off the warnings in the config file!

## Familar Integration

If you're used to using [Rubber Ducky Scripting Language 1.0](https://web.archive.org/web/20220816200129/http://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Duckyscript) or [Flipper Zero's BadUsb ducky extension](https://docs.flipper.net/bad-usb) you'll feel right at home with [DucklingScript](https://github.com/DragonOfShuu/DucklingScript) as we integrate the syntax from both languages and build on it further to help you get the results you want with the code you know.



:::warning
While our ducks are quite smart, they're still not familiar with Rubber Ducky 3.0, sadly this means if you want to use DucklingScript you will have to be comfortable with what they're cracking in Rubber Ducky 1.0.

:::warning[Note For Flipper Compatibility:]
Our ducks use machines not magic, so if you're using a device that can't parse flipper commands make sure to disable them in the config file. We wouldn't want to mix up the nest.
