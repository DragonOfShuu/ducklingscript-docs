# Variables and Functions
## Variables
A variable can be understood as a sort of "drawer" that has a label, and contains some form of data of a specific type (either a string, number, or a boolean). Read more about data types and expression evaluation [here](../wip-page).
```
VAR counter 0
REM a variable named "counter" now equals 0
```
```
VAR switch TRUE
REM a variable named "switch" is now TRUE
REM (Make sure that TRUE is in all caps)
```

## Functions
Functions allow you to run the same piece of code as many times as you want, where ever you want, plus the ability to control the variables inside.

To make a function, use the command named either `FUNC` or `FUNCTION`. After that, give the name, then following the name include all variable names separated by a comma.

To run a function, use the `RUN` command, followed by the name of the function to run, and then the value for all variables separated by comma in order as they were declared on function creation.

### Examples
<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="example1" label="Example 1" default>
    DucklingScript
    ```
    FUNC hello
        STRING Hello World!

    RUN hello
    STRING In the middle
    RUN hello
    ```
    Compiled
    ```
    STRING Hello World!
    STRING In the middle
    STRING Hello World!
    ```
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="example2" label="Example 2">
    DucklingScript
    ```
    FUNC hello phrase,number
        $STRING "The number given was: "+number
        $STRING phrase

    RUN hello "Foo/Bar",10
    ```
    Compiled
    ```
    STRING The number given was: 10
    STRING Foo/Bar
    ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
\
It is also possible to leave a function early if you wish. Using the `RETURN` command, you can exit a function early.

DucklingScript
```
FUNC hello 
    STRING Hello!
    RETURN
    REM This does not run.
    STRING Goodbye!

RUN hello
```
Compiled
```
STRING Hello!
```

:::tip
The return command can also be used outside of a function to exit out of your program early.
