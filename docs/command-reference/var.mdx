# VAR
`VAR` defines a new variable. Give the name, then the value, separated by a space.

**Syntax:** `VAR <name> <value>`

:::warning
Most commands do not evaluate variables by default, to bypass this behavior begin the command with a `$` like so: `$PRINT <varname>`. You can find more information about this in our [Dollar Sign Operator](/docs/simple-commands#dollar-sign-operator) documentation.

Example
```
VAR hello "Hi!"
$PRINT hello
PRINT hello
```
Output
```
Hi!
hello
```
