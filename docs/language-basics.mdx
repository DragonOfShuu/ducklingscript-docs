# Language Basics

First off, DucklingScript allows for all syntax of [Rubber Ducky Scripting Language 1.0](https://web.archive.org/web/20220816200129/http://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Duckyscript), as well as the [Flipper Zero's BadUsb ducky extension](https://docs.flipper.net/bad-usb).

:::warning[Note For Flipper Compatibility:]
If you are not using a device that can parse flipper commands, then you cannot use them. Please make sure to disable flipper commands if this is the case through the config file.
