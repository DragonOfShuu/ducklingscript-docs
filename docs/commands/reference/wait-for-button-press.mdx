# WAIT_FOR_BUTTON_PRESS [[Flipper Command]](https://developer.flipper.net/flipperzero/doxygen/badusb_file_format.html#autotoc_md63)

`WAIT_FOR_BUTTON_PRESS` stops execution and waits for user interaction. Quackinter also supports an extra string to display 
to the user, as it will show up as a window.

:::note
When using the flipper, the flipper will expect a key press to continue 
exectuion. However, Quackinter will expect enter to be pressed, or 
interaction with the button it'll create on screen.
:::

## Syntax
```
WAIT_FOR_BUTTON_PRESS <string QUACKOnly>
```

## Example
<Tabs>
 <TabItem value="generic" label="Generic" default>
    ```
    WAIT_FOR_BUTTON_PRESS
    ```
 </TabItem>

 <TabItem value="quack" label="Quackinter Only">
    ```
    WAIT_FOR_BUTTON_PRESS Finished execution!
    ```
 </TabItem>
</Tabs>
