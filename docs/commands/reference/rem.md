# REM
`REM` creates a comment for your code. You can put anything you like as an argument, if any.

**Syntax:** `REM <optional any>`

Example
```
REM Hello there, this is a comment.
PRINT Hello World
```
Output
```
Hello World
```

Notice that the second line gives an output, but the line with `REM` is treated as if isn't there.
