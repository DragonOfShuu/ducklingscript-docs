# REPEAT/FOR
`REPEAT`/`FOR` allows you to *repeat* a given block of code `<int>` times. 
Also supports an optional parameter for a new variable that keeps count
of the current iteration, which is zero based. 

## Syntax

```
REPEAT <OPTIONAL: count declaration>,<int>
    <codeBlock>
```

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="basic_example" label="Basic" default>
        DucklingScript
        ```
        REPEAT 3
            PRINT Hello World

        FOR 3
            PRINT Goodbye!
        ```

        Output
        ```
        Hello World
        Hello World
        Hello World
        Goodbye!
        Goodbye!
        Goodbye!
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="counter_example" label="Counter">
        DucklingScript
        ```
        REPEAT n,3
            $PRINT "I like the number "+n+"!"

        FOR n,3
            $PRINT "I don't like the number "+(n+3)+" >:("
        ```

        Output
        ```
        I like the number 0!
        I like the number 1!
        I like the number 2!
        I don't like the number 3 >:(
        I don't like the number 4 >:(
        I don't like the number 5 >:(
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::warning
Please note that there is a limit to for loops; for loops will eventually error if they run too many times. This can be avoided however by using inner for loops, but that is not recommended.
