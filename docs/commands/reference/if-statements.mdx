# `IF`/`ELIF`/`ELSE`
`IF`/`ELIF`/`ELSE` allow(s) you to run code, only if a certain condition is met.

`ELIF` can only come after an `IF`, and `ELSE` can only come after an `ELIF` or `IF`. If any `IF` or `ELIF` are true, then all subsequent ELIFs and ELSEs are ignored. After that, you can create a new `IF` statement by using the `IF` command once again.

**System Var:**
```
$IF_SUCCESS
```
If success is true if there was a recent `IF`/`ELIF` statement that resulted to `TRUE`. Value is reset to `FALSE` if there is a new `IF` statement is created, and results to `FALSE`.

**Syntax:**
```
IF <condition>
    <codeblock>
```
